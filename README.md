# TrafficJam

## TrafficJam is a 2D minigame that lets the user choose the correct priority order in which multiple vehicles should pass an intersection


The minigame will randomly generate traffic intersection scenarios in which the user will have to answer the correct priority order
Internally it knows the needed **EU regulations**
## Model:

Here we have a few real-life example of intersections that we want to generate:

- Firstly, it needs at least a direction that vehicles have to follow
- Secondly, it needs at least 2 vehicles with a colliding route as shown above

## Technical:

- **Every direction and vehicle represents and object
- **We link them one to each in a tree like manor
- We determine priority order of multiple cars going in the same direction by their index
- In general, priority is ordered by the level where the object is found on the tree

### C++ integration:
```c++
std::deque<'type'> cars;
std::vector<'type'> dirs;
```
